      <h1 class="pt-wt"> The Page about Me</h1>
      <p class="pt-wt"> My name is Abraham Gilbert and I am an undergrauate student at the University of Rhode Island. The major that I am currently striving for is Computer Engineering.  
          Rhode Island is the place where I grew up and have stayed for all my life. Traveling has not gone past the US borders, or even the northeast.
      <p class="pt-wt"> Computers have been a part of my life  for as long as I can remember. I had always loved to play games and have fun on them, but I never knew or thought about how computers work.
            I decided I wanted to find out how, so I joined the Joys of Programming course to see what it is all about. Besides computers, I loved playing baseball when I was young 
            and going to sports games. I still like sports, but I now mostly watch, rather than play them. My favorite places to go to would be up north
            in Vermont, New Hamppshire and Maine. Even though I have not been to many places, I know I like green hills and the view of water. Other hobbies include collecting antiques and, rocks and coins.</p>
