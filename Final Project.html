      <h1> Final Project: Singular Space Invader </h1>
      <p> This program was made by Abe Gilbert and Caitlin Marriott. It is a game based around the arcade game Space Invaders. Instead of the usual large group
        of enemies, there is one enemy, but it moves and shoots faster, while the player ship moves and shoots slower. This was made to be a littel more challenging and skill based, as you have to aim ahead of the space invader.
        You use the left and right arrow keys to move, while you hold the up arrow key to shoot.
